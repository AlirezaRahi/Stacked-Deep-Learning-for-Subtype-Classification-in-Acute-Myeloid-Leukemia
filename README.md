##  Abstract

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous disease with distinct molecular subtypes that require precise classification for optimal treatment selection. In this study, we propose an ensemble deep learning approach for classifying AML subtypes using gene expression microarray data. Three neural network architectures (1D CNN, Dense Network, and Transformer) were trained and combined through stacking ensemble strategies with XGBoost as the meta-learner. The models were trained using stratified 5-fold cross-validation on a balanced dataset of AML samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our stacking ensemble approach achieves robust performance across all AML subtypes, with particularly strong results for inv(16) and t(8;21) subtypes. These findings highlight the effectiveness of ensemble deep learning in improving classification performance for AML subtyping and suggest its potential for aiding hematopathologists in clinical decision-making.
